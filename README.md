Here are of rules for writing the initial melody (the Cantus Firmus): 

Ref (YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gqL_WDeiI0 by Dr. Guy Shkolnik)

1) Diatonic only - no chromatic notes, whole tones only (max 15 note long)
2) Stepwise motion with a maximum of 4 skips.
3) After a skip of 4th or larger - stepwise compensation in the opposite direction
4) Begin and end on the tonic note
5) The approach to the final tone is in stepwise motion (i.e., the note D before the final C note)
6) One climax note played only once.
7) No immediate repetition (F-F, E-E, etc.)
8) No recurrences of motifs (E-D-C,  F-E-D,  G-F-E)
